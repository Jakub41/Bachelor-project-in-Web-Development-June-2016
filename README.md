# EZBOXRECIPES V 1.0
# BA in Web Development June 2016

The web application is about selling a box with all the ingredients with a recipe, 
so the customer will be able to easy cook a meal without searching for ingridients and for a recipe. 
It is the natural conclusion of the aquired skills during the time spent attending this course. 

What it is interesting in my project is the CMS, which was build using PHP and a MVC pattern. 
The evaluation was really high. However the project should be developed more and some bugs also havae to be fixed.
